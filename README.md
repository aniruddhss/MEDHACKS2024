    <h1>THE HEALTH RESUME - (PROTOTYPE/WORKING DEMO)</h1>
    <h2> Overview </h2>
    <p>The Health Dashboard Prototype is a Python-based web application designed to enhance communication between patients and healthcare providers by providing a comprehensive view of the patient's medical history, ongoing health metrics, and key findings from medical reports. The application leverages AI (via the OpenAI API) to automatically analyze uploaded medical reports and display the results in an interactive dashboard. This project also serves as a prototype for accumulating valuable medical data that can contribute to future AI research in healthcare.</p
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Authentication</strong>: A basic login page to simulate user authentication and secure access to the dashboard.</li>
        <li><strong>Medical Report Upload</strong>: Users can upload medical reports (e.g., blood tests, radiology reports) for AI-driven analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>AI-Powered Analysis</strong>: Automatic summarization and extraction of key findings from uploaded reports using OpenAI.</li>
        <li><strong>Patient Dashboard</strong>: An interactive dashboard divided into three sections:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Information</strong>: Displays the patient’s personal details, current illnesses, medications, and allergies.</li>
                <li><strong>Health Metrics Visualization</strong>: Interactive charts showing health trends (e.g., blood pressure, glucose levels) over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Latest Report Findings</strong>: Key findings from the most recent medical report, as interpreted by the AI.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Data Storage</strong>: Historical key findings are stored for long-term tracking and analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Future AI Research</strong>: Accumulated data can be used to train machine learning models, contributing to advancements in medical AI.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Video Representation</h2>
    <p>To effectively demonstrate the functionalities and potential of this prototype, a video walkthrough have been prepared:</p>
    <h3>Video Walkthrough</h3>
    <p>The video walkthrough includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Flow Demonstration</strong>: A step-by-step guide showing how a user interacts with the application, from logging in to uploading a report and viewing the dashboard.</li>
        <li><strong>Feature Highlights</strong>: In-depth look at the key features, including how the AI analyzes and summarizes medical reports.</li>
        <li><strong>Visuals</strong>: A tour of the interactive charts and personal information sections of the dashboard.</li>
        <li><strong>Impact Discussion</strong>: Explanation of how this prototype could impact patient care and contribute to AI research in healthcare.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This video serves as an engaging way to showcase the application’s capabilities and its potential to revolutionize patient-doctor interactions.</p>
